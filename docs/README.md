TODO: Read install notes for libpcap here:
https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/master/INSTALL.md
There are some packages that need to be installed

TODO: Make sure to note that we need setcap to run the program as a non-root

different network interfaces mean working with NetworkInterface
